LaravelJobber
=============

This is a work in progress to convert a Jobberbase site (http://designjobswales.co.uk) to a Laravel 4 job listing application

The first step is to port essential functionality such as listing jobs, applying for jobs, posting jobs.

It will continue use the jobberbase database for now, but that could do with cleaning up in the future.
